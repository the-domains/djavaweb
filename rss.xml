And if I had to pick a favorite in the latter category, it's Dog Ears Book Barn in the little town of Hoosick, N.Y. Conveniently, it's just a little ways down Route 7 from the Man of Kent, one of America's best bars.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0273a33607950225cc804b6b0df8a694a29cdeef.jpg"></article>]]></description>
